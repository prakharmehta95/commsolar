18. Code debugging and extension for final results simulation
[x] revise prosumer tariff reporting
[x] add behind-the-meter grid extension costs
[ ] add tracking variable of policy subsidies for btm grid extension costs
[ ] add tracking variable for deficit of grid costs due to self-consumption
[ ] speed up code avoiding uses of distance dataframe (e.g., when selecting potential communities)
[x] add starting date (2021) for prosumer tariff

==NOT FOR NOW==
4. Compute distances within model to allow scenarios with different distances
--> out of scope (no scenarios depend on this)
5. Modify assumption for electricity tariff annual growth from exponential to linear
--> retail electricity prices grow so slowly this does not matter
--> wholesale electricity price goes down also so slowly that this probably does not make a change
6. Flexibilize cashflow calculation away from high/low prices to test other tariff designs
--> out of scope (not relevant for research question)
7. Clean up code for speed (e.g., avoid calling model variables within functions of agent, etc)
--> No time for this right now, I will do on the go if I see something
12. Find a way to link the improved profitability of community solar to the ideation variables
--> for example, by taking the average pp of communities and choosing best self.pp or av(pp_com)
-- This is an interesting addition but a bit arbitrary and difficult to implement -> add to discussion
15. Check ammendment of ZEV in 2019, it allowed communities to form across streets
--> add as part of the discussion, suggesting that more flexible regulations for community formation rules
-- could lead to more adoption of PV
18. Add cost of smart meters to individual adoption
--> Consider this to represent a cost of infrastructure for communities
[CANCELED] speed up potential partner/community selection in virtual ZEV scenario
==DONE==
1. Try to get all historical values until 2019 (PV prices is main one missing)
-- updated PV costs, retail and wholesale electricity prices
2. Use weekly average for converting high/low prices from average
-- updated lines 1044-1048 in BuildingAgent.py BUT not SI
3. Check KEV regulation and impose direct marketing when necessary (check EWZ website)
-- it is rather confusing. My conclusion is: After 2018, all installations >500 kWp and all "new"
   installations >100 kWp are obliged to market their electricity directly IF they are part of the FIT.
   By new, this means installations in the waiting list of the FIT before 2018 but built after 2018.
   I could not find an obligation to market electricity directly for installations outside of FIT.
8. Calibrate the model again, test more values for peers/neighbors
9. Introduce annual updates to investment subsidy to follow the reductions of PV prices (as in history)
-- Investment subsidy components reduce every year by the same amount as PV prices
10. Make sure systems 10-30 kWp choose the FIT and NOT the investment subsidy for 2013-2016
-- updated compute_pv_sub: >30 kWp did not have access to inv sub until 2018,
-- and 10-30 kWp we assume take FIT over inv sub until FIT runs out of money in 2016
11. Reduce lifetime of previously existing systems in NPV calculations for communities
-- Creates solar output for the lifetime of the installation that removes the input from prior installations
-- that reach the end of their lifetimes within the community installation lifetime, and passes it to the
-- lifetime load calculation. This way, the NPV is correctly computed because the solar generation of PV
-- installations past their operational lifetime becomes zero.
13. Make the social networks truly Small World Networks by adding a rewiring chance to distant agents
-- rewire prob of 10% follows Rai and Robinson 2015 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.04.014
-- implemented and working but not tested!
14. Check start of the ZEV law. It seems it began in 2018 not 2019
-- changed in model and needs to be updated in text. In several references (Swisssolar, energieschweiz), 
-- it says that the ZEV began in January 2018
16. Make sure communities with wholesale prices do not receive feed-in tariff
-- this was already implemented in compute_lifetime_cashflows line 1136
17. Clean up code for small world network part if works correctly
-- Done and tested
