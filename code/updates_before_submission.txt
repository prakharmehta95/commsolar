1. Try to get all historical values until 2019 (PV prices is main one missing)
2. Use weekly average for converting high/low prices from average
3. Check KEV regulation and impose direct marketing when necessary (check EWZ website)
4. Compute distances within model to allow scenarios with different distances
5. Modify assumption for electricity tariff annual growth from exponential to linear
6. Flexibilize cashflow calculation away from high/low prices to test other tariff designs
7. Clean up code for speed (e.g., avoid calling model variables within functions of agent, etc)
8. Calibrate the model again, test more values for peers/neighbors
9. Introduce annual updates to investment subsidy to follow the reductions of PV prices (as in history)
10. Make sure systems 10-30 kWp choose the FIT and NOT the investment subsidy for 2013-2016
11. Reduce lifetime of previously existing systems in NPV calculations for communities
12. Find a way to link the improved profitability of community solar to the ideation variables
--> for example, by taking the average pp of communities and choosing best self.pp or av(pp_com).
13. Make the social networks truly Small World Networks by adding the possibility of rewiring
to distant agents in the map.
14. Check start of the ZEV law. It seems it began in 2018 not 2019.
15. Check ammendment of ZEV in 2019, it allowed communities to form across streets.
16. Make sure communities with wholesale prices do not receive feed-in tariff.
